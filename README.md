# Boomtown 🏙

Boomtown is a web app that you can go on to share items and borrow items as you please. On your profile page, you can see items that you have shared with others. As you upload your item, you can classify the items and add tags to your items so it is easy for people to understand.

## Learning Lessons

Part 1- Back End Development

The project was informative as I learned how to create the Postgres database from scratch. I learned how to create Queries to fetch and insert items into the Postgres Database and test the Queries using GraphQL.

Part 2- Front End Development

This part of the project mainly focuses on rendering items on the user interface. The focus is on using Apollo Queries to get items and user profiles on their respective pages. The project also concerns on the use of Redux to link the Form and the Preview Component on Share Item Page.
